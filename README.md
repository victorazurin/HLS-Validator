# HTTP Live Streaming

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) allows you to send live or prerecorded audio and video to iPhone, iPad, and other devices including desktop computers, using an ordinary Web server. Playback requires iOS 3.0 or later on devices running iOS; QuickTime X or later is required on the desktop. See the HTTP Live Streaming Overview for more information.


# HLS Validator

Allows to validate HTTP Live Streaming streams.

This program takes an HTTP Live Streaming session and verifies that the index file and media segments conform to the HTTP Live Streaming specification. It performs several checks to ensure reliable streaming. If any errors or problems are found, a detailed diagnostic report is displayed (errors and warning are listed).
